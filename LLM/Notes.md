### Overview of LLM
- Large language models (LLMs) are defined by the number of parameters, also called weights, which control their output.
- Traditional machine learning models typically have between 20 and 200 parameters, whereas LLMs have millions to trillions of parameters.
- LLM Models are trained and operated by tokens - https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer
